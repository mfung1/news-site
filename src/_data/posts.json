access to job and progression opportunities to help young people reach their full potential.<\/p>\n<p>The University of Lincoln has been a key partner in the development of a new set of goals designed to focus on key life stages, from early years through to adulthood, and to provide a benchmark to track progress.<\/p>\n<p>The \u2018Levelling Up Goals have been designed and published by former Cabinet minister, Rt Hon Justine Greening, alongside Britains leading businesses and universities to pinpoint key challenges that, if resolved, would create a level playing field on life and job opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Rt Hon Justine Greening, said: &#8220;If Britain is to achieve levelling up, I believe that we need a galvanising set of Levelling Up Goals that can unite Parliament, business, communities and civil society to work in partnership for the common good of our country. These goals give us a clear set of objectives to level up communities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Time is of the essence. Covid-19 has levelled down our country and therefore made levelling up not only more urgent, but even harder. Whilst the solutions may vary, I believe that these Levelling Up Goals can transcend party politics and set clear objectives for the recovery we need to achieve in our communities. In particular, I know that for different communities, different Levelling Up Goals represent far greater challenges than others. With a clear understanding of the challenges, we can work towards building the recovery in local communities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Its great to be working with the University of Lincoln. Levelling up is ultimately about change on the ground in communities up and down this country and they are playing a crucial role in progressing talent and levelling up Britain. The University of Lincolns support will be absolutely vital. From mental health to supporting our young people to get their schooling back on track, we can work together to make real progress in the recovery from Covid-19.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The University of Lincolns Vice Chancellor, Mary Stuart CBE, said: &#8220;The University of Lincoln was created thanks to the vision and ambition of the people in our region. Our mission is to harness the aspirations of our communities and create new opportunities for all, enhancing our economy and society. That original civic mission is what motivates our work today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are committed to increasing social mobility for our people and we are proud that many of our students are the first in their families to go to university.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Between 2012 and 2016, Justine Greening was the UKs International Development Secretary and worked alongside the UN and 184 international partners to agree the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs were designed to be a &#8220;blueprint to achieve a better more sustainable future for all.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She hopes the \u2018Levelling Up Goals will provide the same framework for government, education, businesses, communities and others to get behind and address the long-running lack of social mobility and inequality of opportunity that exists in Britain.<\/p>\n<p>For more on

Northwest Europes weather: climate scientists aim to untangle jet streams disruptive effects with new seasonal forecasting technique"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"new2017article mainArticleBody\">\n<p>Holidaymakers know all too well the challenge of planning for the British summer &#8211; one day demands sun cream and shorts, the next can require umbrellas and wellington boots.<\/p>\n<p>For meteorologists too the British summer climate has for decades proved stubbornly difficult to make accurate seasonal forecasts about &#8211; in large part due to the disruptive effects of the North Atlantic Jet Stream.<\/p>\n<p>Now a major new research project led by the University of Lincoln, UK, aims to transform the way forecasters model the effects of the jet stream and other atmospheric circulations on the weather of Britain and its near neighbours.<\/p>\n<p>Better seasonal weather forecasts are valuable not just for holidaymakers but also public policy, like authorities responsible for flood prevention, and particularly the food and farming industry &#8211; where a poor harvest caused by extreme weather can wreck livelihoods and push prices up for consumers.<\/p>\n<p>The North Atlantic Jet Stream is a giant current of air which strongly influences seasonal weather conditions in Northwest Europe. Its strength and location can drive extreme weather events in the UK and nearby countries, like flash floods, freezing winters or scorching summer days.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently it was thought the jet stream was too unpredictable to effectively model in seasonal weather forecasts. Its behaviour is believed to be driven by a variety of factors, ranging from sea ice changes to fluctuations in solar radiation. Other atmospheric phenomena &#8211; like the infamous El Ni\u00f1o effect and even volcanic eruptions &#8211; are thought to shape its characteristics from one year to the next.<\/p>\n<p>Modern physics-based dynamical seasonal forecasting systems run on giant supercomputers have enhanced forecasting accuracy for winter months but seasonal forecasts of the summer climate in the UK and Northwest Europe have remained defiantly difficult to model consistently.<\/p>\n<p>A team of climate scientists led by Professor Edward Hanna at the University of Lincoln\u00ffs School of Geography and Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health have been awarded UK Government research funding to develop innovative probabilistic statistical forecasts of the state of the North Atlantic jet stream.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers plan to combine a complex statistical method known as NARMAX and machine learning technologies to provide the UK and Northwest Europe with improved seasonal regional forecasts &#8211; including more accurate summer climate predictions. Pilot studies using the technique, and published in a paper in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society in 2019, have already shown promising results.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Hanna said: &#8220;Recent extreme seasons have been characterised by distinctive jet stream patterns, and jet strength and location are closely linked with extreme weather conditions experienced across the UK and Northwest Europe.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Seasonal weather characteristics have major effects on people\u00ffs livelihoods and the economy with impacts on agriculture, food security, energy supply, public health and wellbeing, and severe weather planning.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our novel application of NARMAX is likely to significantly improve forecast skill and help to inform development of the next generation of dynamical seasonal forecasting systems.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The three-year research project \u2018Northwest European Seasonal Weather Prediction from Complex Systems Modelling\u00ff has been allocated \u00a3650,000 UK Government grant funding from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). It is a collaboration between the Universities of Lincoln, Oxford, Reading, and Sheffield. It will also involve the Met Office, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts and various organisations from the agri-food

modern dating decision-making. The experiments asked groups of 200 participants to view mocked-up dating profiles with basic information including a photo, age, and name.<\/p>\n<p>The research was conducted in partnership with eharmony and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eharmony.co.uk\/dating-advice\/?p=24407&amp;preview=true\">full report has been published on their website.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The data indicated that when viewing time was limited to less than one second, participants were less likely to respond with a \u2018match to a prospective partner. At least one full second of viewing the profiles was needed to make a fully considered decision.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequent experiments looked at profile content and length and found the more information participants had, the more likely they would match with other users.<\/p>\n<p>The research also analysed which factors of a profile are most important when deciding who to match. The biggest considerations for singles choosing a date are, typically, appearance-based factors such as age (65%), weight (54%), and height (46%). Lifestyle considerations such as location (65%), being a non-smoker (65%), and family set-up (45%) are also influential factors in choice of partner.<\/p>\n<p>The research was led by Dr Robin Kramer, Cognitive Psychologist at the University of Lincoln, he said: &#8220;Cognitive psychology helps us to understand the human interactions going on around us every day. Our work with eharmony sheds light onto decisions made when it comes to dating and interacting with a new potential partner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Though nuanced, at the core, the research suggests Brits like to make informed decisions \u2013 the more information they have \u2013 the better they can judge potential compatibility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dating app users spend just one second making a decision about potential partners, according to new research.

University of Lincolns Riseholme campus thanks to a new partnership which is supporting some of the most vulnerable in society.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to a number of farming projects taking place at Riseholme, the University has been growing a significant crop of strawberries on its \u2018robotic fruit farm and fresh vegetables from its walled garden. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, these have been donated to Mint Lane Caf\u00e9 in Lincoln to support the valuable work it does in the community.<\/p>\n<p>Mint Lane Caf\u00e9 is a community caf\u00e9 and charitable organisation, which makes nutritious meals for those in food poverty by using ingredients which might otherwise be wasted. The caf\u00e9 offers a three course meal for \u00a33 on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and also offers food to purchase and take home at very low prices.<\/p>\n<p>The University is part of the Lincoln Food Partnership which is currently developing a City Food Hub, combining all three of Lincolns food banks and the Mint Lane Caf\u00e9. As a collective, the Lincoln Food Partnership is opening a \u2018membership supermarket for those who are eligible for food bank support and they are currently sourcing regular food suppliers to help keep it stocked.<\/p>\n<p>The fresh produce grown at the University of Lincoln comes mainly from the Strawberry Research and Trial Site. A number of research projects take place on this site, as part of a collaboration between the University of Lincoln, Saga Robotics and Berry Gardens Ltd. Supported by Innovate UK funding, the projects focus on using new autonomous systems to increase productivity growth, improve food safety, and reduce the environmental impact of soft fruit production.<\/p>\n<p>Example projects include GRASP-berry, which focuses on the development of high-speed picking robots for soft fruit, and The First Fleet, which aims to produce the world\u00ffs first fleet of multi modal soft fruit robots.<\/p>\n<p>Nigel Curry, Co-chair of the Lincoln Food Partnership said: &#8220;It is brilliant that the Riseholme Campus is able to divert some of its produce into the local food system. Mint Lane Caf\u00e9 provides food to people often in food poverty and receiving fresh food is especially important to help improve peoples diets.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Caf\u00e9 also can make nourishing meals from this fresh produce and supply the food banks with it. The strawberry jam is particularly popular!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jonathan Trotter is Research Projects Coordinator for the Lincoln Institute for Agri-food Technology (LIAT) at the University. He said: &#8220;Were pleased to be supporting these highly important community projects with the fresh food were growing at Riseholme. Previously, our strawberries have supplied catering outlets at the University, but were delighted to be able to share them with the wider community, especially in such difficult times.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People in Lincoln are enjoying the fruits of key agricultural and robotic research projects at the University of Lincolns Riseholme

lockdown, new research shows.<\/p>\n<p>Most people who took part in the research perceived their pets to be a source of considerable support during the lockdown period.<\/p>\n<p>The study from the University of York and the University of Lincoln found that having a pet was linked to maintaining better mental health and reducing loneliness. Around 90 per cent of the 6,000 participants who were from the UK had at least one pet.\u00a0\u00a0The strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species with the most common pets being cats and dogs followed by small mammals and fish.<\/p>\n<p>More than 90 per cent of respondents said their pet helped them cope emotionally with the lockdown and 96 per cent said their pet helped keep them fit and active.<\/p>\n<p>However, 68 per cent of pet owners reported having been worried about their animals during lockdown, for example due to restrictions on access to veterinary care and exercise or because they wouldnt know who would look after their pet if they fell ill.<\/p>\n<p>Lead author, Dr Elena Ratschen from the Department of Health Sciences University of York said: &#8220;Findings from this study also demonstrated potential links between peoples mental health and the emotional bonds they form with their pets: measures of the strength of the human-animal bond were higher among people who reported lower scores for mental health-related outcomes at baseline.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We also discovered that in this study, the strength of the emotional bond with pets did not statistically differ by animal species, meaning that people in our sample felt on average as emotionally close to, for example, their guinea pig as they felt to their dog.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be important to ensure that pet owners are appropriately supported in caring for their pet during the pandemic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Co-author, Professor Daniel Mills from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Lincoln said: &#8220;This work is particularly important at the current time as it indicates how having a companion animal in your home can buffer against some of the psychological stress associated with lockdown. However, it is important that everyone appreciates their pets needs too, as our other work shows failing to meet these can have a detrimental effect for both people and their pets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dr Ratschen added: &#8220;While our study showed that having a pet may mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of the Covid-19 lockdown, it is important to understand that this finding is unlikely to be of clinical significance and does not warrant any suggestion that people should acquire pets to protect their mental health during the pandemic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>More than 40% of UK households are estimated to own at least one pet.<\/p>\n<p>The study also showed that the most popular interaction with animals that were not pets was birdwatching. Almost 55 per cent of people surveyed reported watching and feeding birds in their garden.<\/p>\n<p>The paper, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0239397\">Human-animal relationships and interactions during the Covid-19 lockdown phase in the UK: investigating links with mental health and loneliness<\/a>&#8221; is published in the journal, PLOS ONE.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sharing a home with a pet appeared to act as a buffer against psychological stress during lockdown, new research shows.

Collars Less Effective than Reward-based Training, Research Finds"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"new2017article mainArticleBody\">\n<p>Training dogs with electronic collars is no more effective than traditional training methods, according to new research.<\/p>\n<p>Animal behaviour researchers at the University of Lincoln conducted a study looking at the efficacy of training with electronic or &#8216;E-collars, which deliver a small electric shock to dissuade unwanted behaviour, such as ignoring commands.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers analysed video footage of training sessions where &#8216;come and &#8216;sit commands were given. Training with an E-collar was found to be no more effective than training without, with positive reinforcement found to be the most effective method. The dogs learned to obey commands most quickly when trainers gave consistent signals and rewarded correct responses.<\/p>\n<p>These findings refute claims by some dog trainers that E-collars are a good alternative to reward based training to address highly motivated activities such as wildlife chasing, particularly considering potential risks to the dogs wellbeing, and that their use can lead to unnecessary suffering during dog training.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Jonathan Cooper from the Animal Behaviour, Cognition and Welfare Research Group, said: &#8220;The Reward-Based Control Group had a higher proportion of obeys after first command to both &#8216;Come and &#8216;Sit commands and required fewer multiple commands to initiate a recall or complete a sit response. This suggests that the reward-based training was the most effective approach not only for recall, which was the target behaviour in training, but also for other commands.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the additional potential risks to the animals well being associated with use of an E-collar, we conclude that dog training with these devices causes unnecessary suffering and increased risk to a dogs wellbeing, without good evidence of improved outcomes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The work published in\u00a0<i>Frontiers in Veterinary Science<\/i>\u00a0supports legislation against the use of these devices in pet training in place in Wales and Scotland, provides further evidence to support the end of their sale, possession and use across the whole of the UK.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Training dogs with electronic collars is no more effective than traditional training methods, according to new research.

Could a virus hold the key to fighting drug-resistant bacteria? How can we tackle the climate emergency? And just how good are you at applying sun cream?<\/p>\n<p>These are just some of the questions that secondary school pupils and public visitors will discover the answers to during a week of thought-provoking science events hosted by world-leading researchers at the University of Lincoln.<\/p>\n<p>Experts from across the Universitys College of Science and College of Social Science will host a series of interactive workshops, talks and challenges as part of British Science Week 2020.<\/p>\n<p>British Science Week is an annual celebration of science, technology, engineering and maths, which inspires young students across the UK and encourages them to get hands-on with the science that affects our everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p>From Monday 9th \u2013 Friday 13th March 2020, hundreds of 14-18 year olds will attend a series of free events and discover the ground-breaking scientific research taking place right here in Lincoln. Some evening events are also open to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Dr Rachel Woods from the new Lincoln Medical School will delve into the scientific truth behind the media headlines, to sort fact from fiction. For example, can vitamin pills reduce your risk of cancer? Dr Woods will explore the current evidence for how best an individual can alter their diet and lifestyle to reduce the risk of cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Also from Lincoln Medical School, Dr Jessica Hodgson and colleagues will take students on a journey of the human skeleton, and explore how it forms the basis of our anatomy and plays an important role in our overall health. Students will be invited to take on the skeleton jigsaw challenge and see how quickly they can assemble their bones in the correct order!<\/p>\n<p>In another workshop, Dr Hodgson will invite pupils to take up the sun cream challenge and discover just how well protected they are from harmful rays throughout the summer months.<\/p>\n<p>Pro Vice Chancellor and Head of the College of Science, Professor Libby John, said: &#8220;The University of Lincoln is home to many brilliant scientific minds. It is a hub for pioneering research, and many of our experts are answering some of the most pressing scientific questions facing the world today. Our University students are inspired by these minds every day, and so we are delighted to welcome school pupils from across Lincolnshire to learn from them too and to get hands on with some fascinating STEM studies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dr Neil Holden from the School of Life Sciences will explore two key topics we hear a lot about, but may not truly understand. His workshops will reveal the science behind asthma and the immune system, and will also discuss the basics of virology \u2013 could viruses help us to fight cancer and could they hold the key to tackling drug-resistant bacteria?<\/p>\n<p>Scientists from the University of Lincolns School of Health and Social Care will discuss some of their major research studies involving local and UK-wide ambulance services, together with hands-on experience of emergency care. Visitors will learn about high-tech breathing equipment used in emergency response, and will have the opportunity to learn and practice CPR themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Leading climate change experts will form a panel to discuss the global Climate Emergency and debate the pressing issues facing our world today and into the future, and scientists from the School of Maths and Physics will explore the topics of \u2018knot theory and Pascals triangle.<\/p>\n<p>The following talks and events will take place in the evening and are open to the public.
